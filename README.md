## ECommerce REST API

APIs help integrate several platforms with one another. For example, you can integrate your E-commerce website with a shipping provider's account and import your data for orders and shipments. This way, you can streamline your shipping operations on one platform.

E-commerce fulfillment APIs can help businesses automate, coordinate, manage, and streamline their operations with features such as order fulfillment, courier management, labeling, invoicing, printing shipment information, tracking, and confirmation notifications.

So if you want to establish a solid platform for your E-commerce business, you will need to integrate an API in your shipping and logistics software solution.

- It's Extensible
APIs connect different software components and enable them to interact with each other by receiving requests and sending responses.

It extends the functionality of an application or website, helping you get work done faster. It also simplifies information sharing.

- Increased Security
APIs enhance the security of software systems by letting users request data from your systems. The API protects your E-commerce data with security measures such as encryption.

- Reusability
APIs can be reused across platforms and applications because they are built using a service-oriented approach.

Reusable programs reduce the time and effort developers must spend on the project which in turn increases their productivity.

- Scalability
APIs enable you to connect to any new system without making any changes in the original system, program, or hardware.

It just takes a few lines of code to connect with any new system and offers scalability to handle more complex transactions.

- Synchronization
Due to API integration, you can pick and choose elements of your online store from other applications and programs to create a platform according to your specific business needs. This way you can synchronize your operations workflow in a logical manner.

Through integrated systems, one company can connect to other companiesâ€™ software and applications to manage their data, shipping channels, products and services which best meet their needs.

So as you can see the API revolution involves all of us.

Now let's learn about three common types of API models that get data from systems, turn data into processes, or create an experience.
